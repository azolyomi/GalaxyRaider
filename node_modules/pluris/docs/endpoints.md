Exports Endpoints file. If you are receiving the following error:
```
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './lib/rest/Endpoints' is not defined by "exports" in /node_modules/eris/package.json
```
Please update install the dev branch of Eris by doing `npm i abalabahaha/eris#dev`. This is fixed in v0.14.0.

I'm not going to provide the list of properties here since there are too many. If you really want to document this, feel free to open a PR.
